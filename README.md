This case study covers current challenges in healthcare data governance, current systems in place, and a blockchain proposal that leads itself to smart contracts for patients, providers, and patientsâ€™ personal information as our chosen solution. 
</br> </br>
The exponential growth of healthcare data presents several new and long-standing challenges to people, processes, and policy information in the healthcare sector.
</br> </br>

</br> </br>
Large volumes of big data in healthcare is regularly associated with challenges surrounding quality, privacy, ethics, and compliance concerns (Baloch et al., 2023) against a constantly changing technological landscape.
</br> </br>
In current healthcare systems, theft of patient data usually involves health records, insurance, addresses, card payment & billing information (Adeniyi et al., 2025). These current systems for security and storage share a common feature in that data management is centralised. This has only further pushed the tolerance of the healthcare sector to accepting centralisation and its issues as general consensus.
</br> </br>
Our blockchain proposal, therefore aims to advance the move from electronic records and traditional filing systems, with the intention to grow the outpaced current systems with decentralisation (Blockchain Aspect) and automation (Smart Contract Aspect) into accounts.
</br> </br>
Smart contracts act to automate data-sharing agreements with specified actions under certain conditions (Kasypapa & Vanmanthi, 2024). This effectively encodes, deploys (onto blockchain network), and self-executes code under predetermined rules specifying consent and access between parties, patients, institutions, government agencies, or other healthcare providers over shared information exchange.

To combat common problems displayed in current patient informatiomn systems we have developed our prototype including the use of smart a contract. Our smart contract has a specific use case for patient and provider users in the healthcare sector. 
This prototype executes two tasks:
     <ol class="custom-bullets" type="1">
        <li>Patient users: Making queries to decrypt and retrieve their patient personal information, which was decrypted and stored off-chain,</li>
        <li>Provider User: Gain access privileges to this patient's personal information when authorised by the patient user</li>
    </ol>

The Smart Contract has been developed using the program Foundry, a blazing fast, portable and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development written in Rust. It consists of four essential tools that suffice all the needs a blockchain app developer will ever have.

To run the Foundry application, i used the development tool "Visual Studio Code" which is a text editor development application.

This repository is about a smart contract that stores Patient personal information, Blood Test Results, Imaging Results, and Medications. It also grants time based access to medical professionals granted by the patient.
